- Enter the value of 'k'

4). It will load the data to drivers_matrix from the drivers_dataset.txt file

5). Once you enter the number of clusters, It will apply the K-Means and give you following output:

- pop up window with the picture of the cluster and also it will be saved in the main directory under the name TermProject1 as 'clusters_kn.png'
- squared error value for specified k
